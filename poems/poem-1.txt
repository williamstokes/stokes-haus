A forest of water columns: runoff
through gaps in the pavement, three stories
above the parking lot, spots
unmarked by lines but full
and temporary. Sideways wind
from the river, noiseless, columns jittering
like the dancing fountain at LaGuardia
ba ba buh buh buh
ba ba buh buh buh buhhh
the news will not spread that you have left
whether today or later today
stormwater filling the basin to the curb
and spilling through pitcherspout back into the dockyards
