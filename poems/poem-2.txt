The thing about seeing it is
it can see you back, pencil lead
eyes at daybreak on the surface of
a black lake. Onshore in the glass refectory
glass eye tracing the preponderance of
static, gathering mass or mullein, almost
colorless as it grows, ions, air, dust—she wrote
"when the lightning hit the mute
swan. In all her glory. She
exploded. Her five cygnets
sizzled on the surface." Is it a form of
self-conscious commotion, the Novocaine
and post-game traffic, long lines
of redlights switchbacking across
the minor valleys of Birmingham?
Looted mounds and creeks dammed with silt and
construction netting, blaze orange—hymenocallis
coronaria clawing back the shoals
as they erode, unlike night, stone
by stone to the Tensaw Delta
