The thing about seeing it is / it can see you back, pencil lead / eyes at daybreak on the surface of / a black lake. Onshore in the glass refectory / glass eye tracing the preponderance of / static, gathering mass or mullein, almost / colorless as it grows, ions, air, dust—she wrote / "when the lightning hit the mute / swan. In all her glory. She / exploded. Her five cygnets / sizzled on the surface." Is it a form of / self-conscious commotion, the Novocain / and post-game traffic, long lines / of redlights switchbacking across / the minor valleys of Birmingham / mounds and creeks dammed with silt and orange / construction netting, hymenocallis / coronaria clawing back the shoals / as they erode, unlike night, stone / by stone to the Tensaw Delta
