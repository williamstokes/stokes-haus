Now this				
is a country :		
watch it flap 		
that			        
jock adjusting jock
palming gym shorts			     
frozen drink
gone soft :				  
muscled fuselage :
unbroken skin				
on Rockaway Beach :
runway crosswinds			 
waking up windsocks
teens gawking		
lats and
and pecs :		  		
and man
some guys just don't want 		
missile news
or, a girlfriend :		
coastal horseflies :
shard piercing foot 		
in sand's reddening crater :
overheard downbeach : 
"I'm not dying				
for fucking Israel—"
overhead, the big blue plane to
seoul
my quadjet widebody			   	     
across these moving plates :    
& so much time 			    
before sunset :		
isn't there? 		
until
the grey 		
accumulation :
double tap strikes on
iran
soundstage 
rain &
midnight		      
spectacle :
kite 		
failing
before			  
the dunes :
this June :		 
this    
tentative wind
this wavering
before
the dive—
